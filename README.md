# Hello friends! Welcome to Webe Sushi! 
Webe Sushi is a fun project combining two different skills I have cultivated over the years: Sushi Chef and Web Developer.

Webe sushi is a Full-stack web application for a Pickup/Togo sushi restaurant featuring all menu made by me. I had tons of fun building this project. Please let me know if you have any constructive feedback for my web-app. Enjoy! 

disclaimer: This is not an actual restaurant. 
All sushi made by William Benarto, pictures taken by Jin Choi.
